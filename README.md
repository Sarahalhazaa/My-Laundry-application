# Project Description
My laundry app will be responsible for receiving and delivering clothes to customers after the selected laundry service has been performed. The app will reduce the rate of lost clothes due to forgetfulness. Additionally, it will contribute to reducing unemployment by providing job opportunities for delivery positions. Moreover, it serves as a marketing tool for laundries by connecting them with customers.

The app will allow registration and account creation for laundries, customers, and drivers. It will display a list of available laundries starting from the nearest to the customers' locations. Laundries can showcase their services in the app to enable customers to choose suitable services. Drivers will pick up clothes from customers and deliver them to the laundries, then return them to the customers.

Features of my laundry app include easy ordering of customer needs, order tracking, displaying nearby laundries to customers, and easy registration for laundries and drivers.
